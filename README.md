ISP Network design

An ISP Network (Internet Service Provider Network) is the complete infrastructure that allows you to connect to the internet. It is the "behind-the-scenes" system that delivers internet to homes, offices, and mobile devices. 
Project Overview 

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a complete ISP (Internet Service Provider) network using Cisco Packet Tracer.
The goal is to show how an ISP delivers internet from backbone routers to regional networks and finally to end users.
This project can be used for networking assignments, practical learning, or as a reference for CCNA-level ISP architecture.

Features of This Project

✔ ISP Backbone Router Setup
✔ Regional Distribution Network
✔ Core, Distribution & Access Layer Design
✔ Static / Dynamic Routing (based on your file)
✔ DNS / DHCP / NAT configuration (if included)
✔ Proper IP Addressing Scheme
✔ End-user connectivity with successful ping test
✔ Realistic ISP network flow

How to Use ISP Network Design in Cisco Packet Tracer

This ISP Network Design project can be used in Cisco Packet Tracer by simply opening the “ISP_Network_Design.pkt” file in Packet Tracer 8.x or higher, where the complete ISP topology—including backbone routers, regional routers, distribution switches, and access layer devices—will appear. You can click any device to view its configuration through the CLI, test connectivity using the ping command from any PC, and verify routing using commands like “show ip route” and “show running-config.” Users can modify the network by adding routers, switches, servers, PCs, or changing IP addresses, routing protocols, VLANs, NAT, and DHCP settings. After making changes, the project can be saved normally using “File → Save” or “Save As” to create updated versions.
